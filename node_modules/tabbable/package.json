  "readme": "# tabbable\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/tabbable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidtheclark/tabbable)\n\nReturns an array of all\\* tabbable DOM nodes within a containing node. (\\* \"all\" has some necessary caveats, which you'll learn about by reading below.)\n\nThe following are considered tabbable:\n\n- `<button>`s\n- `<input>`s\n- `<select>`s\n- `<textarea>`s\n- `<a>`s with `href` or `xlink:href` attributes\n- `<audio>`s and `<videos>`s with `controls` attributes\n- `[contenteditable]` elements\n- anything with a non-negative `tabindex`\n\nAny of the above will *not* be considered tabbable, though, if any of the following are also true about it:\n\n- negative `tabindex`\n- `disabled`\n- either the node itself *or an ancestor of it* is hidden via `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`\n- it's an `<input type=\"radio\">` and a different radio in its group is `checked`\n\n**If you think a node should be included in your array of tabbables *but it's not*, all you need to do is add `tabindex=\"0\"` to deliberately include it.** (Or if it is in your array but you don't want it, you can add `tabindex=\"-1\"` to deliberately exclude it.) This will also result in more consistent cross-browser behavior. For information about why your special node might *not* be included, see [\"More details\"](#more-details), below.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Accurate (or, as accurate as possible & reasonable)\n- No dependencies\n- Small\n- Fast\n\n## Browser Support\n\nBasically IE9+.\n\nWhy? It uses [Element.querySelectorAll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll) and [Window.getComputedStyle()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install tabbable\n```\n\nDependencies: *none*.\n\nYou'll need to be compiling CommonJS (via browserify or webpack).\n\n## API\n\n### tabbable\n\n```\ntabbable(rootNode, [options])\n```\n\nReturns an array of ordered tabbable node within the `rootNode`.\n\nSummary of ordering principles:\n- First include any nodes with positive `tabindex` attributes (1 or higher), ordered by ascending `tabindex` and source order.\n- Then include any nodes with a zero `tabindex` and any element that by default receives focus (listed above) and does not have a positive `tabindex` set, in source order.\n\n#### rootNode\n\nType: `Node`. **Required.**\n\n#### options\n\n##### includeContainer\n\nType: `boolean`. Default: `false`.\n\nIf set to `true`, `rootNode` will be included in the returned tabbable node array, if `rootNode` is tabbable.\n\n### tabbable.isTabbable\n\n```\ntabbable.isTabbable(node)\n```\n\nReturns a boolean indicating whether the provided node is considered tabbable.\n\n### tabbable.isFocusable\n\n```\ntabbable.isFocusable(node)\n```\n\nReturns a boolean indicating whether the provided node is considered *focusable*.\n\nAll tabbable elements are focusable, but not all focusable elements are tabbable. For example, elements with `tabindex=\"-1\"` are focusable but not tabbable.\n\n## More details\n\n- **Tabbable tries to identify elements that are reliably tabbable across (not dead) browsers.** Browsers are stupidly inconsistent in their behavior, though — especially for edge-case elements like `<object>` and `<iframe>` — so this means *some* elements that you *can* tab to in *some* browsers will be left out of the results. (To learn more about that stupid inconsistency, see this [amazing table](https://allyjs.io/data-tables/focusable.html)). To provide better consistency across browsers and ensure the elements you *want* in your tabbables list show up there, **try adding `tabindex=\"0\"` to edge-case elements that Tabbable ignores**.\n- (Exemplifying the above ^^:) **The tabbability of `<iframe>`s, `<embed>`s, `<object>`s, and `<svg>`s is [inconsistent across browsers](https://allyjs.io/data-tables/focusable.html)**, so if you need an accurate read on one of these elements you should try giving it a `tabindex`. (You'll also need to pay attention to the `focusable` attribute on SVGs in IE & Edge.) But you also might *not* be able to get an accurate read — so you should avoid relying on it.\n- **Radio groups have some edge cases, which you can avoid by always having a `checked` one in each group** (and that is what you should usually do anyway). If there is no `checked` radio in the radio group, *all* of the radios will be considered tabbable. (Some browsers do this, otherwise don't — there's not consistency.)\n- If you're thinking, \"Why not just use the right `querySelectorAll`?\", you *may* be on to something ... but, as with most \"just\" statements, you're probably not. For example, a simple `querySelectorAll` approach will not figure out whether an element is *hidden*, and therefore not actually tabbable. (That said, if you do think Tabbable can be simplified or otherwise improved, I'd love to hear your idea.)\n- jQuery UI's `:tabbable` selector ignores elements with height and width of `0`. I'm not sure why — because I've found that I can still tab to those elements. So I kept them in. Only elements hidden with `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` are left out.\n- Although Tabbable tries to deal with positive tabindexes, **you should not use positive tabindexes**. Accessibility experts seem to be in (rare) unanimous and clear consent about this: rely on the order of elements in the document.\n- Safari on Mac OS X does not Tab to `<a>` elements by default: you have to change a setting to get the standard behavior. Tabbable does not know whether you've changed that setting or not, so it will include `<a>` elements in its list.\n\n***Feedback and contributions more than welcome!***\n",
